"Scrap 2 Records but as a website" 

This is an indirect fork of the Records Manager, using it for the game Scrap Clicker 2 and the relatively large competitive/Records scene within the community. 
For years, they were exclusively on the wiki: https://official-scrap-2.fandom.com/wiki/Records
However, updating them could take a lot of time, so I created the Records Manager and other tools to speed it up, which was effective (3x speed). 
This also comes with an alternative UI, that being the Github page of this, with extra tools for the users - such as a search bar. 

Differences to the wiki for normal users/spectators: 
- Categories at the left, no scrolling to the top every time
- Search for category names and table content (player name, number, etc.)
- Highlight contents
- Show top 10 only, or all
- Upside down
