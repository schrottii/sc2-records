## What is Records Manager?
Tool to manage game records that are written via Wikitext (wiki) tables, with tools to edit or update them faster and easier, and other neat things. 
It is still a work-in-progress, with new content and better explanations coming.

## How to use
It can be used locally, with savedata that is saved locally. Using it publicly for a game can be done by creating a fork, adjusting the config.js, keeping the updated data in wikidata.js and publishing it via GitHub pages or similar. 

## License
If you want to organize records for a game (or something else) yourself, you can copy/fork it and work with your wiki data. Feel free to edit the config.js and style.css. 
Be aware with other things, they could mess with later pulls. 
You may not make money with it (besides donations), remove the credits/donation button to me, or pretend that the record management system is yours.
